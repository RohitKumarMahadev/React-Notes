Why React is safest bet?
------------------------
As they say, 2016 is an year of Javascript fatigue. But what is it?!

Let's play a game.
Write down all the frameworks/build tools/libraries you can think of for 30 seconds straight and then stop.

Ready,  set,  go!

>Ember, Angular, React, Express, Grunt, Bower, npm, Broccoli, Gulp, Lodash, Underscore, rxjs, Knockout, SocketIO, Threejs, D3, Backbone, Ionic, Angular2, React Native, Redux, Alt, Reflux, Webpack, Bluebird, Q, Express, Mocha, Jasmine, Chai, Koa, Less, Sass, Postcss, Impressjs, Revealjs.

Tired yet? In short, that’s what **JavaScript fatigue** is.

You know what? We are suffering with *paradox of choice*. Let's put all the bells and whistles aside.

We just know JavaScript and we love it. We wan't to stand on the shoulder of this giant to solve the state management problem, the root cause of all this evil, which has been pushed from backend to frontend, no matter which framework comes and go.

1. As JavaScript tackles bigger and more complex problems, We want a higher level of abstraction without much variance from the language itself.

2. We don't want to carry away with the drift of technologies, language syntax and semantics, unnecessary services and controllers which may not be needed in our app.

3. We want something that is easy to reason about and don't want any auto-*magic* to happen under the hood within a framework/library.

4. In simple, we want a view layer that *just* takes care of "data to HTML".


Having said this, **React** from Facebook exactly solves this problem.

It is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It will introduce some useful concepts like components, application state and stateless functions that will prove useful even in Vanilla Javascript apps or no matter which framework or libraries one end up using.

It's true strengths are **composition, unidirectional data flow, freedom from DSLs(Domain Specific Languages), explicit mutation and static mental model.**

It  has a large ecosystem of other packages and libraries that you can plug and play when it is needed in your app instead of dumping everything on your head, and its sheer popularity(>50K stars in github) means you’ll be able to find a lot of help from community.


**TL; DR**

In short, React forces you to think and write better JavaScript apps that scales, not a framework oriented apps.

>Do you know React being a View library can be integrated into any of **MV*** frameworks as a view layer?

Wow!! You'he sold me. But, how does React solves our old problem of complexity? How does it effectively handles the state?
